Overview

These projects are part of a series of exercises that involve working with PIC microcontrollers to control LEDs, handle timers, manage interrupts,
and interact with peripheral devices like LCDs. The simulations are conducted in Proteus, and the hex code for the microcontroller is generated using MikroC. 
The projects aim to demonstrate various functionalities, such as SPI communication, Timer0-based LED blinking, digital clock implementation, and input/output control through external buttons.
Tools and Software Used:

    Proteus: For circuit design and simulation.
    MikroC: For writing code and generating the hex file to program the microcontroller.
